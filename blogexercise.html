<p class="first">You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>

<p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee. </p>

<p>Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'? </p>

<p class="first">We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about.</p>

<p>Let's make a happy little mountain now. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy.</p>

<p>You can spend all day playing with mountains. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. You gotta think like a tree. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? We'll put some happy little leaves here and there.</p>
